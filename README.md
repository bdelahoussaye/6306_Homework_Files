# 6306_Homework_Files

This repo contains all homework submitted to the SMU MSDS class (6306) including associated data sets and code where applicable.  

The files are all denoted with a numerical "n" typically following the text "homework" indicating the corresponding week of the semester.  Most weeks will contain multiple files depending on the questions assigned during the homework, but typically include:
## "Rmd" file containing a question heading, natural language where appropriate, R code as required, and the results of R code.
## "txt" file will typically contain swirl() exercise results
##  "html" file will contain the knitted contents from the "Rmd" file into a singular doc
## "R Project" file related to the associated Rmarkdown

This repo will also contain associated data sets, as appropriate, utilized in completing the homework.  As an example, the file "fivethirtyeight.csv" contains the .csv of the data 'college_all_ages' utilized in the "Homework4" content.  This data - 'college_all_ages' was pulled from the repo of https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight.  This repo is also branched on this particular github account (as of 6/1/18) for reference.
